 **Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Python Learning Project!** 

This repository is designed to provide a fun and interactive way to learn Python programming. Whether you are a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding of Python, this project will guide you through the essentials and more advanced concepts.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the simple/basic version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Ideal for beginners.
- **`advanced.py`**: Contains a more complex version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Suitable for those looking to explore advanced Python concepts.
- **`index.html`**: A mock version of the CLI game, available on GitHub Pages for easy access and interaction.

## What You Will Learn

By exploring this repository, you will learn:
- Basic Python concepts: functions, loops, conditionals, and lists.
- Advanced Python features: list comprehensions, exception handling, and more.
- How to structure and organize a Python project.
- Best practices for writing clean and readable code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MariferVL/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Run the Basic Version**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Run the Advanced Version**:
   ```bash
   python advanced.py
   ```

4. **Visit the GitHub Page**:
   Explore the mock CLI game by visiting [GitHub Pages](https://marifervl.github.io/tic-tac-toe/).

## Learning Approach

### Start from Scratch

Feel free to create your own version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch. Follow these steps to guide you:
1. Print the game board.
2. Take user input for moves.
3. Check for winning conditions.
4. Alternate between players.
5. Handle invalid inputs and edge cases.

### Step-by-Step Code Review

Alternatively, you can review the provided code in `main.py` and `advanced.py`, and understand what each line does. Here are some key functions and concepts to focus on:
- **Printing the board**: Understanding nested loops.
- **Taking user input**: Using `input()` and handling exceptions.
- **Checking for a win**: Implementing win conditions.
- **Switching players**: Using conditionals.
